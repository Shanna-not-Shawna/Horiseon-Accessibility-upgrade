# Horiseon Accessibility Upgrade

## Description

I upgraded the Horiseon webpage to meet accessibility standards. All div tags were replaced with semantic HTML elements, alt descriptions were added to images, and the HTML and CSS code was simplified. This website is now more easily accessible for everyone and optimized for search engines.
